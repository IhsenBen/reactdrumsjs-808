# Project Summary

I made this project with React JS for a freeCodeCamp certificatioin, it's a drum machine inspired by the classic drum machine Roland TR-808.

I  used a class componenent, states, props and event listners for the logic, and for the style I used css grids, shadows, and an external package for the buttons.
